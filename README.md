# Linear Algebra

We all know that linear algebra is **important**.

It has protagonist (leading) role to play when we are dealing with data.

## Why linear algebra?

The essence lies in the factor that we can visualise in 2d (2-dimensional space) and scale the same understanding in nd (n-dimensional space).

## What can we start with?

Linear algebra starts with a point followed by vector and matrices. Let's try to break and understand them in a geometrical fashion.

### Point:

We can visualise **point** as a real point in coordinate axes.

As discussed, let's start with 2d and extend it to nd.

Thus, a point with (x,y) makes a point in 2d and (x,y,z) in 3d so on.

### Vector:

Many of us might have heard vector is something that has both direction and magnitude.

So to build on our understanding, let's continue with point and draw a line from origin towards point.

For a 2d vector with [1 2] vector:

- Start at origin
- Traverse 1 unit in 1st dimension
- From that point move 2 units in 2nd dimension.

Repeat the same steps for [1 2 3] vector:

- Start at origin
- Traverse 1 unit in 1st dimension
- From that point move 2 units in 2nd dimension
- From the new destination travel 3 units in 3rd dimension.

Just iterated it again so that we can map to concept of scaling our understanding from 2d to nd.

- Generally vectors in dimensions are denoted with i, j, k.
- Vectors in a particular dimension with unit length are called as unit vectors.
